Develop a JavaScript application - text chat room:

* After opening a page, user should enter his name
* After entering the name user should join new chat room
* There can be several chat rooms at the same time
* User can copy link to the room and send to another user to invite him
* User can send text messages to the chat and all users in the chat will see message
* Users should see who sent message to the chat and when
* Users should see who is in the chat room right now

Extra feature: 

* add possibility to start video streaming from users webcamera, so other participants of the chat room will see video andaudio from that user.

Solution should:

* Be written primarily in JavaScript

* Use socket.io for communication between the client and the server
* Use React JS for UI
* Use WebRTC for the video chat part
